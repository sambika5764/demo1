        The Ramanathaswamy Temple in Rameshwaram is historically linked to Lord Rama, who is believed to have performed rituals to atone for killing Ravana, a Brahmin. The current structure was largely built in the 15th century by King Udayian Sethupathi and later expanded in the 17th century by King Kizhavan Sethupathi and the Jaffna Raja. The temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines and houses two main lingams: the Ramalingam created by Sita from sand, and the Vishvalingam brought by Hanuman from Mount Kailash.
